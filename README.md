# GenPwd Mobile

This is work-in-progress to port the dead simple [GenPwd](http://alphajuliet.com/lab/GenPwd.html) 
JavaScript/HTML5 web app to mobile, using the cross-platform
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) framework, and related libraries.

Source code for the GenPwd app is also on
[Github](https://github.com/alphajuliet/GenPwd).
